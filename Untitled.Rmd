FOOL OF A TOOK 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Import data and load packages
```{r}
limpet <- read.csv("~/UCL/R Lessons/Dr Cooper Workshop/limpet.csv")
library(tidyverse)
```

Visualise the data 
```{r}
ggplot(limpet, aes(x = DENSITY, y = EGGS, colour = SEASON)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8, size = 2.5) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("forestgreen", "tomato3")) +
  theme_bw()
```

Visualising data differently 
```{r}
ggplot(limpet, aes(x = DENSITY, y = EGGS, fill = SEASON)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw()
```
